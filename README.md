# Graph Drawing

Given a graph, where do you draw the nodes such that the graph looks ‘good’? What does it mean for a
graph to look visually nice in the first place? Several criteria exist, such as edge crossing, area needed,
symmetry, number of bends in edges, the smallest angle between two edges that share a node, etc

Various algorithms have been designed that try to optimize for different criteria. In this project, we will
investigate these algorithms, and implement them ourselves.

## Installation

Concerning the installation you just need to go on the root directory and run the following command

```bash
  pip install .
```

The project was build with the version of Python 3.7
    
## Run Locally

To start using the project you have to generate graph

```bash
  python3 main.py --generate
```

## Features

Right now the program can generated the following type of graphs:
- Cycle graphs

The implemented drawing algorithms are:
- None
